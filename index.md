## Abstract

We studied the performance of a fortysomething man of limited atletic potential in weekly 5km 'parkrun'. Although the subject reported that he enjoyed the events, we found little evidence of sustained improvement in finishing time or age-graded performance. Further studies as to the effect of alcohol, diet and injuries are required.
